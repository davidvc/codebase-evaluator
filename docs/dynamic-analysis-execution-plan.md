# Dynamic Analysis Execution Plan

## Objective

Implement a system for dynamic analysis execution within the codebase evaluator project. This system will allow analysis tasks to be defined and executed based on configuration files, enabling flexible and customizable analysis criteria without changing the code.

## Plan

1. **Configuration System**:

   - Create a configuration file (e.g., JSON or YAML) to define analysis tasks.
   - Each task will include details such as the task name, description, and whether it can be executed in parallel.

2. **Dynamic Task Execution**:

   - Modify the existing workflow in `src/workflow.py` to read the configuration file.
   - Dynamically add nodes to the workflow based on the tasks defined in the configuration.

3. **Parallel Execution**:
   - Identify tasks that can be executed in parallel.
   - Set up the workflow to execute these tasks concurrently to improve efficiency.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create Configuration File**:

   - Define a file `analysis_config.json` in the `src` directory.
   - Include tasks such as `structure_analysis`, `component_discovery`, `integration_analysis`, and `quality_assessment`.

2. **Modify Workflow**:

   - Update the `create_analysis_workflow` function to load and parse the configuration file.
   - Add nodes to the workflow dynamically based on the configuration.

3. **Test and Validate**:
   - Ensure that the workflow executes tasks as defined in the configuration.
   - Validate that parallel tasks are executed concurrently.

## Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Easily add, remove, or modify analysis tasks without changing the code.
- **Efficiency**: Execute tasks in parallel where possible to handle larger codebases effectively.
- **Customization**: Tailor analysis criteria to specific project needs through configuration.
