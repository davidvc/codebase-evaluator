# Project Plan: Java Codebase Evaluator System

## Scope Definition

This system specifically targets Java codebases using Maven project structure:

- Standard Maven directory layout (src/main/java, src/test/java, etc.)
- Java source files and Maven configuration (pom.xml)
- Directory-based component identification
- Basic Java best practices

Future versions may expand to support other languages and build systems.

## Analysis Pipeline

The system will use a focused workflow for Java/Maven projects:

1. Repository Indexing

   - Clone and index the repository
   - Create searchable database of code content

2. Maven Structure Analysis

   - Validate Maven directory layout
   - Parse POM file
   - Verify required directories exist

3. Directory-Based Component Discovery

   - Map components based on directory structure
   - Identify source components (under src/main/java)
   - Identify test components (under src/test/java)

4. Component Analysis

   - Analyze source components
   - Analyze test components
   - Map dependencies between components

5. Quality Assessment

   - Basic Java coding standards
   - Maven best practices
   - Directory organization
   - Dependency management

6. Report Generation
   - Project structure overview
   - Component organization
   - Quality metrics
   - Recommendations

## Expected Project Structure

The system expects standard Maven project layout:

- pom.xml at root
- src/main/java for source code
- src/test/java for test code
- src/main/resources and src/test/resources for resources

## Execution Steps

- [x] Create basic repository indexer
- [x] Create basic workflow system
- [x] Create basic report generation
- [x] Implement Maven structure analyzer
- [x] Implement directory-based component discovery
- [x] Create basic component analysis
- [ ] Write functional test using a real LLM and a real repository (dewey codegen)

## Current Status

The project has the basic workflow infrastructure in place. We now need to implement the Java/Maven-specific analysis functionality, starting with the Maven structure analyzer.

## Next Steps

1. Implement Maven structure analysis to validate project layout
2. Create POM file parser to understand project configuration
3. Implement directory-based component discovery
4. Update tests to verify Maven/Java analysis
5. Add basic quality metrics
6. Create dependency analysis

## Benefits of Simplified Approach

1. Clear directory-based component identification
2. Standard Maven structure validation
3. Simple test identification (based on directory)
4. Basic dependency management
5. Straightforward package organization
6. Easy to understand and maintain
7. Clear separation of concerns
8. Reliable component boundaries
9. Simple upgrade path
10. Focus on essential metrics
