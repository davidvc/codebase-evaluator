Here‚Äôs a summary of the talk "üöÄ TDD, Where Did It All Go Wrong" by Ian Cooper:

1. **Background on TDD Concerns**:
   - Ian Cooper, having practiced TDD for over a decade, reflects on its challenges and issues.
   - Experienced issues with TDD, like test suites growing overly large, maintenance difficulties, and breaking tests with code changes, which slowed development.

2. **Mocking and Unit Testing Challenges**:
   - Observed excessive use of mocks leading to tests that didn't truly validate functionality.
   - Cooper noted that TDD often focuses on classes rather than system behaviors, causing issues when testing changes.

3. **Misinterpretations of TDD Concepts**:
   - Emphasizes the need to test behaviors rather than implementation details or specific methods.
   - Many practitioners misunderstand the unit of isolation, focusing on classes rather than behaviors and modules.

4. **Impact on Code Refactoring**:
   - TDD should enable refactoring, but too many tests for specific implementations hinder changes and slow development.
   - Suggested only introducing new tests for new behaviors, not during refactoring.

5. **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) Approach**:
   - Proposes using a BDD approach to focus on testing behaviors instead of implementation details.
   - Mentioned Dan North‚Äôs insight that ‚Äúbehavior‚Äù instead of ‚Äútest‚Äù might be a better focus to drive development.

6. **Clean Code and Architecture**:
   - Advocates for starting with simple code to fulfill test requirements, then refining it during refactoring.
   - Discussed hexagonal architecture as a way to organize code and tests effectively.

7. **Critical Reflection on Tooling and TDD Evolution**:
   - Critiques the heavy use of mock-heavy testing frameworks and overuse of dependency injection in testing.
   - Cooper suggests using tests only for public APIs, avoiding IOC containers in test setups.

8. **Concluding Thoughts on TDD Practice**:
   - Stresses testing the external behavior of systems, not internal details.
   - Encourages a simplified, behavior-focused approach to testing that aligns with Kent Beck‚Äôs original TDD philosophy.
